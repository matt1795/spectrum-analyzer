Hello, and welcome to my spectrum analyzer project. This is the first report of
many for documenting my journey of designing (leaning heavily on other designs)
and building a spectrum analyzer. This document summarizes initial research,
states the goals of the project, and lays out work/experimentation needed for
the beginnings of the project.
