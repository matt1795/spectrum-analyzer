\section{Summary}

I've been really wanting to jump into RF stuff since finishing my electrical
engineering degree at BCIT. One of the issues here though is that I lack a
spectrum analyzer, and don't quite have a few grand to throw at one. So I
concluded that I might as well make one.  It probably won't be the fanciest in
town, but the process of designing and building one should teach me tons, and at
the end I will have something to work with.
