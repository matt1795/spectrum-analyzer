\section{Goals}

The main purpose/goals for this project are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Hands on experience with RF circuits}
	\item{Design PCB Layout for RF Circuits}
	\item{Get a sweet SA}
	\item{Catalyst for even more RF work}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Long-Term}

So once all of this is done and I've got a halfway decent spectrum analyzer
designed, I want to create a digital interface for use on a linux based machine.
This would also be a large undertaking since the analog to digital interface is
a module unto itself, and I will likely get a reason to finally make a linux
kernel driver, which I've been wanting to do for a while. And then from there
the benefits for experimentation would be awesome, a programming interface for
testing and access to more data for all sorts of computations.

\section{Design}

\begin{circuitikz} \draw
	(0,0) to[short,o-] ++(0.3,0)
	to[lowpass,>] ++(2,0)
	node[mixer] (m) {}
	(m.1) to[short] ++(-1,0)
	(m.2) to[vco] ++(0,-1);
\end{circuitikz}

The overall system design comes mostly from \cite{qsl} and I will be extensively
experimenting with each module's implementation.

\section{Next Steps}

I plan on experimenting and designing the modules one after the other as I go,
making sure to do integration tests to make sure that I get expected system
performance once multiple modules are added togther.

Each lab will be focused on implementing a single module,
