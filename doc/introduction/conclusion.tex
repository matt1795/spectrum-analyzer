\section{Conclusion}

In ths lab we thoroughly examined the mechanisms in which Matlab loads, saves,
and manipulates image data. Matlab does provide a convenient platform in which
to experiment with and implement image processing. 

The functions and methods used in this lab will clearly be used throughout the
course. It was extremely important for us to manually go through some of the
images and inspected their values. Separating an image into its RGB channels was
very illustrative, as well as playing around with the indexing functionality.

Task 4 provided some challenge for writing Matlab scripting which was a good way
to end things off since now we will be doing more advanced operations on images.
