This lab focuses on the mechanisms in which Matlab loads, saves, and manipulates
images. First simple loading and saving was experimented with, and an image was
compared at varying degrees of quality. Next was an exploration of RGB color
representation where an image was broken down into its three color channels as
well as translated into an indexed image. Autocorrelation of a single row was
done at the end of the lab, it was concluded that compression algorithms likely
use correlation in order to detect repeating patterns within images.
